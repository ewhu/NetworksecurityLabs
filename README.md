# NetworksecurityLabs: Real-time Traffic Analysis for IoT Network Intrusion Prevention
Real-time traffic analysis framework utilizing machine learning anomaly detection for IoT network intrusion prevention systems.

## Detailed Description
The NetworksecurityLabs repository provides a comprehensive real-time traffic analysis framework designed to detect and prevent intrusions in IoT networks. This framework utilizes machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques to identify potential security threats in real-time, enabling swift response and mitigation. The solution is particularly suited for IoT networks, where traditional security measures may not be effective due to the unique characteristics of IoT devices and communication protocols.

The framework's primary objective is to provide a robust and scalable solution for IoT network security, addressing the growing concern of IoT-based attacks. By analyzing network traffic in real-time, the framework can identify anomalies and suspicious patterns, allowing for prompt alerts and countermeasures. The machine learning models employed in the framework are trained on large datasets of normal and anomalous network traffic, enabling them to learn and adapt to new threats over time.

The NetworksecurityLabs framework offers several benefits, including improved threat detection, reduced false positives, and enhanced incident response. The solution is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy integration with existing IoT network infrastructures and security systems.

## Installation
To install the NetworksecurityLabs framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/NetworksecurityLabs.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the framework: `npm run start`

## Configuration
The framework requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `TrafficAnalyzerConfig`: specifies the configuration for the traffic analyzer module
* `MachineLearningModelConfig`: specifies the configuration for the machine learning model
* `SocketIOConfig`: specifies the configuration for Socket.io

## Usage
The NetworksecurityLabs framework provides a comprehensive API for integrating with other security tools and systems. The API consists of the following endpoints:

* `/traffic/analyze`: analyses network traffic and returns a list of detected anomalies
* `/machinelearning/train`: trains the machine learning model using a provided dataset
* `/machinelearning/predict`: predicts anomalies in network traffic using the trained machine learning model

For example, to analyze network traffic and retrieve a list of detected anomalies, send a POST request to `/traffic/analyze` with the following JSON payload:
`{ traffic: [<traffic_data>] }`
